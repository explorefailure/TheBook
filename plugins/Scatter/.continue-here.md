# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 0 Complete - UI Design Finalized

UI mockup v4 finalized and implementation files generated. Ready for Stage 1 (Planning).

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Granular reversed delay with stuttering grains, randomized pitch quantization, and stereo randomization
- Parameters specified: 9 parameters (Delay Time, Grain Size, Grain Density, Pitch Random, Scale, Root Note, Pan Random, Feedback, Mix)
- UI vision captured: Grain cloud visualization showing position in time/stereo/pitch space
- Use cases identified: Textural ambience, evolving soundscapes, abstract musical atmospheres

**UI Mockup:** ✓ v4 Finalized
- Version 4: Cream spacey textured skeuomorphic with centered cluster layout
- Window size: 550×600px
- Layout: Controls clustered around central 200×200px particle field visualization
- Visual style: Warm cream/beige palette, 3D knobs with shadows and gradients, grain texture, cosmic glow effects
- Controls: 7 large knobs (90px diameter), 2 combo boxes (scale/root note)
- Files: v4-ui.yaml, v4-ui-test.html (with finalized: true marker)

**Implementation Files:** ✓ Generated
- v4-ui.html (production HTML with JUCE bindings)
- v4-PluginEditor-TEMPLATE.h (C++ header with correct member order)
- v4-PluginEditor-TEMPLATE.cpp (C++ implementation with 9 parameter bindings)
- v4-CMakeLists-SNIPPET.txt (WebView build configuration)
- v4-integration-checklist.md (Stage 5 implementation steps)
- parameter-spec.md (9 parameters: 7 sliders + 2 combos)

## Next Steps

1. Run `/plan Scatter` to create implementation plan (Stage 1)
2. Review plan and estimate implementation
3. Run `/implement Scatter` to build plugin (Stages 2-5)

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Effect (Delay)
- Core concept: Granular reversed delay with beautiful stuttering grains, pitch quantization to musical scales, and randomized stereo placement
- Tempo sync: Yes, with note values for delay time
- Grain behavior: Random forward/reverse per grain, overlap-based density, windowed playback
- Pitch randomization: ±7 semitones quantized to selected scale/root
- Primary use case: Textural ambience and evolving soundscapes

**Parameter Count:** 9 total
- 7 continuous float parameters (sliders/knobs)
- 2 choice parameters (combo boxes)
