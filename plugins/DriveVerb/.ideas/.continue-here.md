# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for DriveVerb. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Reverb with warm tape saturation on wet signal only
- Parameters specified: 6 total (Dry/Wet, Drive, Decay, Size, Filter, Filter Position)
- UI vision captured: 5 rotary knobs + 1 toggle switch
- Use cases identified: Driven ambience for drums, synths, creative sound design

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start implementation directly
3. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Audio Effect (Reverb)
- Core concept: Algorithmic reverb with warm tape saturation (even harmonics) applied only to wet signal
- Reverb type: Algorithmic (CPU-efficient)
- Decay range: 0.5s to 10s (medium to cathedral-length tails)
- Size: Room dimensions (small booth to large hall)
- Drive range: 0-24dB (aggressive saturation capability)
- Filter: DJ-style from GainKnob implementation (center=bypass, negative=low-pass, positive=high-pass)
- Filter position: Switchable pre/post drive for creative routing
- Default preset: Subtle (30% wet, 6dB drive, 2s decay, 40% size, 0% filter, post-drive)

- PLUGINS.md (updated with DriveVerb entry)
