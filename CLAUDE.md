# THE BOOK - Project Instructions

## Session Start Display

At the beginning of each session, display the SessionStart hook output to the user. This includes:
1. The ASCII art banner
2. Environment validation results (Python, cmake, Xcode, JUCE, pluginval, etc.)
3. The validation summary

Present this information clearly so the user can see their environment status.
